# dit4c/docker-squash

[![](https://badge.imagelayers.io/dit4c/docker-squash:latest.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=dit4c/docker-squash:latest)

An Alpine Linux [docker-squash](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-squash) image.

It's much smaller than other images because while it uses Go to install `docker-squash` it doesn't leave it installed.
